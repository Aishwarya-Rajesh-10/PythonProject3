Treasure Hunt Game (Python)

Overview
The **Treasure Hunt Game** is a simple, fun, text-based adventure game built using Python.  
The player embarks on a journey to find hidden treasure on a mysterious island.  
At each stage, the player makes choices — and those decisions determine whether they win or lose!  

This game is inspired by the classic “choose your own adventure” style and is perfect for beginners who are learning Python basics such as:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- String input handling
- Logical decision-making

1. **Start the Game** — The player begins at a crossroad and must choose to go **left** or **right**.
2. **Reach the Lake** — If the player chooses **left**, they reach a lake and must decide to **wait** for a boat or **swim** across.
3. **Choose the Door** — Upon reaching the island safely, the player finds a house with **three colored doors**: red, blue, and yellow.
4. **Find the Treasure!** — Only one door leads to the treasure, while the others lead to danger and the end of the game.

Each choice leads to a different outcome — some result in victory, others in game over!

Features
- Fully text-based — runs directly in a terminal or IDE console.
- Uses ASCII art for an engaging game introduction.
- Interactive story with multiple possible endings.
- Great beginner project to practice:
  - Input handling
  - Conditional logic
  - String manipulation

Concepts Covered
- User Input: Using `input()` to receive player decisions.
- Conditional Statements: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the story flow.
- String Methods: Using `.lower()` to handle case-insensitive input.
- ASCII Art: Enhances the visual feel of the game in a text environment.
